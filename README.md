## Development Workflow

To build the site, run `npm run build`; alternatively, if grunt-cli is installed globally you may simply run `grunt`. Note that the SCSS build process currently depends on the Sass Ruby gem, >= 3.4.0 (`gem install sass`).

To start the dev server, run `npm start` (or `grunt dev`): a development server will be started on http://localhost:1337/
